1. Are we using a CSS framework? I vote yes as it will save time for responsiveness to be implemented. Also this would take care of class name duplicates (i.e. container)

2. Did we get verification from Bob that SASS works for our new tech? 

3. Here is a wireframe of what I have in mind, does this sync up with what you guys are thinking, and either way, lets make a clear list of roles/responsibilities for each member.

4. Who is handling the JS/Handlebars functionality? We should use Handlebars whenever possible.

5. ARE WE LIKING AND DISLIKING COMMENTS, QUESTIONS, OR BOTH?
